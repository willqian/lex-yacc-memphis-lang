EXAMPLE 1: TREES

This initial examples introduces the basic concepts of Memphis.

Domain declarations introduce data types by listing alternative
ways to construct hierarchical values values.

Match statements allow the processing of these values by giving rules for
the alternatives. Rules are selected by matching a value against a posibly
nested pattern.

The example defines a data type Tree and function that traverses
values of this type.
